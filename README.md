## Update to MapLibre Navigation SDK for Android

We recommend that you use the successor of the GraphHopper Navigation SDK, which is the [MapLibre Navigation SDK](https://github.com/maplibre/maplibre-navigation-android).
An example where GraphHopper routing is integration is available [here](https://github.com/graphhopper/graphhopper-navigation-example).

## Getting Started

Building your own turn-by-turn navigation app based on GraphHopper is easy. Just sign up for the [GraphHopper Directions API](https://www.graphhopper.com/products/).

GraphHopper does not provide map tiles. The navigation sdk is compatible with MVT vector tiles and raster tiles. There are several map providers, including:
- [Mapilion](https://mapilion.com/)
- [MapTiler](https://www.maptiler.com/cloud/)
- [ThunderForest](http://thunderforest.com/)

*Note: while it's possible to use raster tiles, we recommend vector tiles for mobile applications.*

Enter your GraphHopper API key and map style url in the developer config: `app/src/main/res/values/developer-config.xml`

You can fork this project and adapt it to your needs, or use it as orientation when developing your own application.
